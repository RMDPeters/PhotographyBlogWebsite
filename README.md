This is my attempt at a creating a website to share various photographs I've taken. Additionally, it will help me become more comfortable using HTML.

Here's how I'd like for my website to look...

1) Images should have tags that can be grouped together to create 'albuns'. ie. Season, location, subjects, time of day, etc. 
2) Images should be selectable (clickable), that shows a description of the image. This should definitely include: ISO, shutter speed, aperture, etc.
3) The main page should have a section for: Gallery, Contact (Footer), Equipment, Meet Me, What's Next
4) The site will be simple and static to start, but eventually it should become dynamic and engaging, while running smoothly across all devices.
5)
